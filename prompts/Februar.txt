A picture in winter with one wooden barrel sauna, one white cat and a lit lantern. The barrel sauna is located at the left-hand side of the picture and the roof is covered with snow. Next to the sauna is sitting a cute, curvy, white cat with black dot eyes looking very happy. A tree is on the right-hand side of the picture. An owl is sitting in the tree. A lantern is dangling from a branch of the tree. In the background is trees and the night sky.
